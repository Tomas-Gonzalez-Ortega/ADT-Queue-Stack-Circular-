 * Description: Deque is an abbreviation for double-ended queue. It is a data structure in which the elements can only be added or removed from front and back of the queue. A typical deque implementation support the following operations: Insert at front an element, insert at back an element, remove from back an element, remove from front an element, list the front element and list the back element implemented using a doubly linked list.
 * The time complexity of all the deque operations using a doubly linked list can be achieced O(1)

 * dequeue is O(n) : all the remaining elements have to be shifted
